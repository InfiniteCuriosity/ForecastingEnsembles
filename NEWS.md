# ForecastingEnsembles 0.2.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
There is one note, which says, " Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and importing
  selectively is preferable."
The function uses all the packages each run. Removing any of the packages will reduce the accuracy of the results, and/or the features returned to the user. ForecastingEnsembles has been tested on numerous platforms, and runs without any errors or warnings.
